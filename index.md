## Workshop 2: Blockchains + Economics
    
Our second workshop focuses on research and practice at the intersection of Economics and Blockchains. Blockchains provide coordination between many parties when there is no single trusted party. However, each of these parties has its own incentives, and their actions may well be towards maximizing these incentives instead of following the specified protocols. Can we achieve protocol designs in this ecosystem where parties are incentivized to follow the protocol? We will have a series of talks from industry and academia shedding light on this topic.

## About the Series

Blockchain, as a source of decentralized trust, is forming the underlying infrastructure for a variety of applications such as payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), the decentralized web (Web3), NFTs, and even cryptography protocols. Given how blockchains relate to such a wide variety of applications and to so many areas of computer science and economics, there is a lot to learn and understand how this field evolves. With Blockchains + X, we will conduct a series of workshops each focusing on some subset of topics.
