Blockchain, as a source of decentralized trust, is forming the underlying infrastructure for a variety of applications such as payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), the decentralized web (Web3), NFTs, and even cryptography protocols. Given how blockchains relate to such a wide variety of applications and to so many areas of computer science and economics, there is a lot to learn and understand how this field evolves. With Blockchains + X, we will conduct a series of workshops each focusing on some subset of topics.
    
## Workshop 1: Blockchains + Trusted Execution Environments
    
Our first workshop focuses on research and practice at the intersection of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Blockchains. Trusted hardware provides us with a source of trust rooted in hardware, and they find applications in the design of consensus protocols, mitigating MEV, and well perhaps even improving cryptography protocols. Is the use of trusted hardware too strong of an assumption? Doesn't it trivialize the problem? Isn't it broken?

We will have a series of talks from industry and academia focusing on some of the topics discussed above and perhaps shedding some light on answering some of these questions too!

### Speakers
- Mic Bowman, Intel
- Matt Green, Johns Hopkins University
- Natacha Crooks, UC Berkeley
