Blockchain, as a source of decentralized trust, is forming the underlying infrastructure for a variety of applications such as payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), the decentralized web (Web3), NFTs, and even cryptography protocols. Given how blockchains relate to such a wide variety of applications and to so many areas of computer science and economics, there is a lot to learn and understand how this field evolves. With Blockchains + X, we will conduct a series of workshops each focusing on some subset of topics.
    
## Workshop 1: Blockchains + Trusted Execution Environments
    
Our first workshop focuses on research and practice at the intersection of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Blockchains. Trusted hardware provides us with a source of trust rooted in hardware, and they find applications in the design of consensus protocols, mitigating MEV, and well perhaps even improving cryptography protocols. Is the use of trusted hardware too strong of an assumption? Doesn't it trivialize the problem? Isn't it broken?

We will have a series of talks from industry and academia focusing on some of the topics discussed above and perhaps shedding some light on answering some of these questions too!

| 10.45 AM - 11.15 AM | Heidi Howard               | <details><summary>Confidential Consortium Framework: Building Secure Multiparty Applications in the Cloud (Without Handing Over the Keys to the Kingdom!)</summary><br> **Abstract:** In the pre-cloud era, computer systems were operated by the organizations which depended upon them. This on-premises approach gave organizations great power over their systems, however, “with great power comes great responsibility” and organizations were left with the ongoing burden of deploying and managing their own infrastructure. Today, Cloud computing has removed much of the responsibility of deploying systems, however, it has also removed much of the power that organizations once had. Organizations must place their trust in the cloud to secure the confidentiality and integrity of their data. <br> <br> In this talk, I'll consider whether it is possible to regain control over data in the cloud (great power with none of the responsibility) and even enable multiple untrusted parties to compute together on untrusted infrastructure. I’ll introduce the Confidential Consortium Framework (aka CCF), an open-source framework for building a new category of secure multiparty applications with confidentiality, integrity-protection, and high availability. CCF utilizes hardware-based trusted execution environments for remotely verifiable confidentiality and code integrity, backed by an auditable and immutable distributed ledger for data integrity and high availability. CCF even enables application developers to bring both their own application logic and a custom multi-party governance model, in the form of a programmable constitution. By the conclusion of this talk, I hope to have convinced you that distributing systems does not necessarily mean distributing trust in the era of trusted execution in the cloud.
